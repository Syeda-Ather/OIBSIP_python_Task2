# OIBSIP - Python Programming Task 2: BMI Calculator

##  Task Title:
BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator

##  Objective:
To build a beginner-friendly Python application that calculates a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) and classifies it into categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) based on WHO standards.

##  Tools & Technologies:
-   VS Code
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries Used:** None (Only built-in functions like `input()`, `float()`)

##  Features:
- Takes user input for **weight (kg)** and **height (meters)**
- Validates inputs (no zero or negative numbers)
- Calculates BMI using the formula:  
- Classifies the BMI based on WHO guidelines:
- Underweight: < 18.5  
- Normal weight: 18.5 – 24.9  
- Overweight: 25 – 29.9  
- Obese: ≥ 30
- Displays clear results with proper formatting

##  Files Included:
- `bmi_calculator.py` – Main Python script
- `screenshots/` – Folder containing code screenshot(s)
- `README.md` – This documentation file

##  How It Works:
1. The user is asked to enter their weight and height
2. Input is validated using exception handling
3. BMI is calculated using the formula
4. The BMI value and category are printed

##  Screenshots:
Screenshot(s) of the code are included in the `screenshots_bmi_calculator/` folder.
